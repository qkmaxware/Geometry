# Altering Geometry
The built in  `Qkmaxware.Geometry.IMesh` interface used to represent geometry throughout this library. `ListMesh` is a concrete implementation of this interface which uses a list as its storage structure and is immutable by nature. This means that alterations create new ListMesh instances rather than effecting the original mesh data. 

## Affine Transformations
In `Qkmaxware.Geometry`, affine transformations are represented using the `Qkmaxware.Geometry.Transformation` class. Transformations can then be applied to geometry by pre-multiplying the transformation to the mesh object. Transformations can be combined in sequence by pre-multiplying them. 

### Displacement
The displacement transformation is used to move geometry around 3d space. To create a displacement transformation, the `Offset` static constructor method of the `Transformation` class can be used to specify the displacement that you want to apply to a mesh.

```cs
var NewMesh = Transformation.Offset(new Vec3(3, 4, 5)) * OldMesh;
```

### Scale
The scale transformation will shrink or grow geometry and can be created by the `Scale` static constructor method of the `Transformation` class.

```cs
var NewMesh = Transformation.Scale(2 * Vec3.One) * OldMesh;
```

### Rotation
Rotation transformations will rotate a geometric object around 3D space. These transformations can be created by the `Rx`, `Ry`, `Rz`, and `EulerRotation` static constructor method of the `Transformation` class. 

```cs
// Rotation around a specific axis
var NewMesh1 = Transformation.Rx(1.57) * OldMesh; // Rotate 90 degrees around the X axis
var NewMesh2 = Transformation.Ry(1.57) * OldMesh; // Rotate 90 degrees around the Y axis
var NewMesh3 = Transformation.Rz(1.57) * OldMesh; // Rotate 90 degrees around the Z axis

// Arbitrary rotation in 3D space
var NewMesh4 = Transformation.EulerRotation(new Vec3(1.57, 0.15, 3.2)) 
```

### Custom Transformations
Besides each of the transformations above, you can define an arbitrary transformation using the `Transformation` class constructor. For this constructor the elements of the affine transformation matrix are directly provided. Below you can see how the matrix elements map to the constructor parametres. 

<div style="width: 100%; display: block;">
    <div style="display: inline-block; margin: 12px;">
        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>e01</td> <td>e02</td> <td>e03</td> <td>e04</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>e11</td> <td>e12</td> <td>e13</td> <td>e14</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>e21</td> <td>e22</td> <td>e23</td> <td>e24</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>1</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
    <div style="max-width: 50%; display: inline-block; margin: 12px;">
<code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">var transformation = new Transformation(
    e01, e02, e03, e04,
    e11, e12, e13, e14,
    e21, e22, e23, e24
)
</code>
    </div>
</div>

## Modifier Stacks
Geometry modifiers are non-destructive decorators which can be used to apply arbitrary modifications to geometry. Modifiers can be stacked to apply geometric modifications successively without damaging the original geometry,

### Array
The array modifier, `Qkmaxware.Geometry.Modifiers.Array`, will repeat geometry multiple times moving them by a given amount on each repetition.

<div style="text-align: center">
    <img width="256" src="/Geometry/img/ArrayModifier.png"/>
</div>

### Path Deformation
The path deformation modifier, `Qkmaxware.Geometry.Modifiers.PathDeform`, will deform a geometry such that it follows a path.

<div style="text-align: center">
    <img width="480" src="/Geometry/img/PathDeformModifier.png"/>
</div>

### Mirror
The mirror modifier creates a new mesh that is mirrored across the given axis containing both the original triangles as well as the mirrored triangles. 

<div style="text-align: center">
    <img width="480" src="/Geometry/img/MirrorModifier.png"/>
</div>

### Subdivide
The subdivide modifier creates a new mesh in which each triangle has be sub-divided into 4 smaller triangles. This modifier can be used to increase the resolution of a given geometry.

<div style="text-align: center">
    <img width="480" src="/Geometry/img/SubdivideModifier.png"/>
</div>

### Scale
The scale modifier operates identically to the scale transformation. However, by being a modifier it does not allocate any additional mesh data until it is used whereas the transformation immediately creates a new mesh with the modified vertices. 

### Displace
the displace modifier operates identically to the offset transformation but as a modifier. This behaves the same as the scale modifier. 

### Path To Mesh
The path to mesh modifier creates a tube shaped mesh by following a path segment. Effectively this allows for one to convert a path object into a 3d mesh which follows the shape of the path. 

### Render GCode
The render g-code modifier uses tubes to trace the path for a print-head of a 3D printer in order to convert 3D printer flavoured GCode back to a 3d model.

<div style="text-align: center">
    <img width="480" src="/Geometry/img/RenderGcode.png"/>
</div>

### Explode
The explode modifier pushes the original triangles apart as if they were exploded outwards from their original locations. 

### Boolean Operations
Boolean operations are a set of operations common in the field of computer aided design. There are several different modifier which are capable of performing boolean operations.

#### Union
the union modifier combines non-overlapping polygons from two geometry into a new geometry. Besides being offered as a modifier, this operation can also be done with the `Union` method of the `ListMesh` class, or by using the overloaded `+` operation.

<div style="text-align: center">
    <img width="256" src="/Geometry/img/BooleanUnion.png"/>
</div>

#### Difference
the difference modifier is used to cut geometry out of a mesh where it overlaps with another geometry. Besides being offered as a modifier, this operation can also be done using the `Difference` method of the `ListMesh` class, or by using the overloaded `-` operation.

<div style="text-align: center">
    <img width="256" src="/Geometry/img/BooleanDifference.png"/>
</div>


#### Intersection
The intersection modifier is used to save only the parts of a geometry where they overlaps with another geometry. Besides being offered as a modifier, this operation can also be done using the `Intersection` method of the `ListMesh` class, or by using the overloaded `&` operation.

<div style="text-align: center">
    <img width="256" src="/Geometry/img/BooleanIntersection.png"/>
</div>

## Raw Triangles
If the above alteration methods do not work for your use case, you can create new geometry by looping over the individual triangles within a mesh and creating new triangles by altering the vertices. 

```cs
IMesh CustomTransformation(IMesh mesh) {
    List<Triangle> newTriangles = new List<Triangle>();
    foreach (var triangle in mesh) {
        var vertex1 = AlterVertex(triangle.Item1);
        var vertex2 = AlterVertex(triangle.Item2);
        var vertex2 = AlterVertex(triangle.Item3);

        newTriangles.Add(new Triangle(vertex1, vertex2, vertex3));
    }
    return new ListMesh(newTriangles);
}
```
